# Web-based-Covid-19-Detection

Overview
This project implements a COVID-19 detection system using machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify medical images, such as X-rays or CT scans, for COVID-19 diagnosis. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection, streamlining the diagnostic process, and aiding in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Technologies Used

Python, OpenCV, NumPy (Image Processing)
TensorFlow (Deep Learning for CNNs)
Keras (Model Building)
Matplotlib, Pandas (Data Visualization & Management)
## Key Features
✔ Real-time COVID-19 detection from X-ray/CT scan images
✔ Transfer learning with VGG16 for feature extraction
✔ Binary classification (COVID-19 vs Normal)
✔ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
✔ Web application for easy image upload and real-time predictions

## Workflow
1️⃣ Preprocess the medical images (resize, normalize, augment)
2️⃣ Train a CNN model using X-ray images for COVID-19 classification
3️⃣ Evaluate the model on test data (X-ray images of COVID-19 and healthy lungs)
4️⃣ Build a web interface using Flask for user-friendly access
5️⃣ Provide real-time COVID-19 detection and results visualization

## Future Enhancements

Implement additional image datasets (CT scans, etc.)
Explore more advanced CNN architectures like ResNet, DenseNet
Improve the web application with mobile support for real-time detection
